# Delivery fee calculator

This is my take on Wolt summer 2023 engineering internship [pre-assignment](https://github.com/woltapp/engineering-summer-intern-2023). 

## To run the app:

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

The app runs on localhost:5173

## To run tests:

`npm run test`

Coverage report is shown after tests have ran. After the initial test run, whenever a file is saved, tests will automatically run in watch mode for some files.
This can create a confusing coverage report. To run all tests while in watch mode, type `a` in the terminal. This will create a full coverage report.

## Technologies:

Vite project with React and TypeScript.

Testing done with Vitest and React Testing Library.
